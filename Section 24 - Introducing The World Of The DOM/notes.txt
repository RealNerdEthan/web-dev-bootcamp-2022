---DOM---
Document object model. It is a Javascript representation of a webpage. It's your JS "window" into the content
of the webpage. It is essentially a bunch of objects that you can interact with via JS. It's how we do things
like make drop down menus function.

---JavaScript Element---
An Element in Javascript is an object with properties that represets a single HTML Element.

You can select Elements in 3 ways:
getElementById (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById)
getElementsByTagName (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getElementsByTagName)
getElementsByClassName (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementsByClassName)

---HTML Collection---
Is an array like object that displays HTML Element proerties and methods. Is Generated when we use getElementById, getElementsByTagName, and getElementsByClassName.

---querySelector---
A newer additon to the DOM, querySelector is an all-in-one method to select a single Element.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector

There is also querySelectorAll: Same idea, returns a collection of matching Elements instead of just the first match.
