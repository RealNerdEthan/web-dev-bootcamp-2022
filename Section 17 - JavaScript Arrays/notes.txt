---JavaScript Array---
An Array is an ordered collection of values. Example: Comment on a post, songs in a playlist, etc.
Arrays have length. Example: arrayName.length will return a length just like a string would.
JavaScript allows for any find of data type to exist inside, even other arrays.

In an array, each element (or thing) has an index which will start at 0.

With an array, you can use indexOf to update a value in the array. Example: colors[0] = "red"; or colors[2] = "yellow";

---Array Methods--- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Arrays)
Push: Add value to the end of the array.
Pop: Remove the last value at the end of the array.
Shift: Remove the first value at the beginning of the array.
Unshift: Add a value to the beginning of the array.

Less common methods:
Concat: Merge arrays
Includes: Look for a value
indexOf: Just like a string.indexOf
Join: Create a string from an array
Reverse: Reverses an array
Slice: Copies a portion on an array
Splice: Removex/Replaces elements
Sort: Sorts an array

Coding exercise had me access an array within an array and update a single value from Null to "Hugo".
airplaneSeats[3].splice(2,1,"Hugo");
