An Array is an ordered collection of values. Example: Comment on a post, songs in a playlist, etc.
Arrays have length. Example: arrayName.length will return a length just like a string would.
JavaScript allows for any find of data type to exist inside, even other arrays.

In an array, each element (or thing) has an index which will start at 0.

With an array, you can use indexOf to update a value in the array. Example: colors[0] = "red"; or colors[2] = "yellow";
