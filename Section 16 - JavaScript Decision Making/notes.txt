---Compairison---
Compairison signs:
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
== equality (checks that values are equal but doesn't evaluate type) (converts both to the same type, then compares)
!= not equal
=== strict equality (checks that vales AND types are the same, doesn't do any conversion)
!== strict non-equality

Best practice is to use ===.


---Turthy and Falsy---
Falsy values are: false, 0, ""(empty string), null, undefinied, NaN. 
Everything else is Truthy!
