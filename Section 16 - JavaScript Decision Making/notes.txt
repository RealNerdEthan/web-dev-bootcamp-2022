---Compairison---
Compairison signs:
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
== equality (checks that values are equal but doesn't evaluate type) (converts both to the same type, then compares)
!= not equal
=== strict equality (checks that vales AND types are the same, doesn't do any conversion)
!== strict non-equality

Best practice is to use ===.


---Turthy and Falsy---
Falsy values are: false, 0, ""(empty string), null, undefinied, NaN. 
Everything else is Truthy!


---Logical Operators---
&& And (both left and right have to be true for the entire thing to be true)
|| Or (if one side is true, the entire thing is true)
! Not (inverses the inherent truthy or falsy of a value making what was true to be now false and what was false to be now true)


---Switch Statement---
Is a control flow statment that can replace multiple if statemnts. It's not very commonly used but something to be aware of.
