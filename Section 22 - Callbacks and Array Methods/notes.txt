This section is all about built-in array methods that require us to pass in functions. It's a crucial part of working with arrays
in JavaScript and arrays are crucial to working with JavaScript, so the topic is important.

-forEach
-map
-filter
-find
-reduce (less important than the others)
-some
-every

---For Each---
Accepts a callback function. Calls the function once per element in an array. They are also older and there are times you could
substitute these for newer syntax.

---Map---
Creates a new array with the results of calling a callback on every element in the array. Works very much for forEach but then
generates a new array based on the result.

---Arrow Functions---
Allows us to write functions without having to use the keyword "function".
