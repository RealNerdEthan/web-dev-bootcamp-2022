---Default Params---
When creating a function, it can optional to have a user input a value, and if theu don't we cab use a default value (parameter).

---Spread In Function Calls---
It's kind of like the swiss army knife of JavaScript. We are taking something and exapnding or "spreading" it out (array, string, etc).

---Spread With Array Literals---
Create a new array using an existing array. Spreads the elements from one array into another.

---Spread With Object Literals---
Copies properties from one object into another object. Often used when copying objects.

---Rest Params---
The syntax looks like spread but it's not, we're not spreading things out we are collecting them into a single parameter. 
Collects all remaining arguments not specifically called out into an actual array of their own.

---Destructuring Arrays---
A short, clean syntax to "unpack" values from arrays and properties from objects into distinct variables.

---Destructuring Objects---
Destructing is more commonly used with an object because it's not all about the order of the elements, but instead looks at their
key value property. Example: {name: Ethan} instead of look for index 0 of an array
This doesn't change the original object in any way.

---Destructing Params---
Most frequently used with objects, we can destructer values that are being passed into the function.
