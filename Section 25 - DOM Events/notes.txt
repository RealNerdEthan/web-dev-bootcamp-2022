---Inline Events---
Written directly in the HTML element we can add an attribute called "onclick="".
There are others such as onfocus, onpause, ondrag, and more. This isn't the recommened
way to add JS to HTML elements but it is an option. Also note the functionalty
only applies to the one HTML element and would need to be coded for every one
you want to do that function/action.
