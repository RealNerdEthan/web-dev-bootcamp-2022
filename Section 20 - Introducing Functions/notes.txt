---Functions Intro---
Functions are reusable chunks of code. Super useful for reducing the 
duplication of code and making code easier to understand.

A function is a 2 step process. You "define" the function (telling JavaScript 
about it) then you can "run" the function whenever and as many times as you
want.

Defining a function:
function funcName(){
    do something;
}

---Argumanets---
Are a fance way of saying inputs to a function. The part in the ().

---Parameters---
A parameter is a variable passed to a function and gives value to the argument 
in the function.

Example:
Parameters are the aliases for the values that will be passed to the function. The arguments are the actual values.

let foo = function( a, b, c ) {}; // a, b, and c are the parameters
foo( 1, 2, 3 ); // 1, 2, and 3 are the arguments

---The Return Keyword---
Built-in methods "return" values when we call them. We can store those values
to a new variable. Also the return keyword stops the execution of your function.
You can only return 1 thing. It could be an array, but only 1 array.
