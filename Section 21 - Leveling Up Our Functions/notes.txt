---Function Scope---
Where we define a variable in JavaScript impacts where we have access to it.

---Block Scope---
Block refers to any content with {} that isn't a function (Example: conditional statements or loop)

---Lexical Scope---
A child (or inner) function nested inside a parent (or outter) function has 
access to the parent's functions. This contnues on for every nested function
inside another nested function. They all have access to their "parent"'s 
functions.

The parent function DOES NOT have access to their child's variables.

---Function Expressions---
Function expression is a way of storing a function in a variable. JavaScript
considers function just another value like any other.
