---Object Literals---
Objects in Javascript are similar to arrays in that they store information and can combine multiple types of data, unlike arrays
they store data via key-value pairs or "properties". The order (or "index") doesn't matter like it does in an array, instead we want labels 
for the information in the form of a "key" which is tied to a "value".

Keys are converted to strings, so even a number would be converted to a string.

Example: const person = {firstName: "Ethan", lastName: "Goddard", age: 31, hobbies: ["3D Printing", "Board Games", "Coding"], isLoggedIn: false};
Another way to format it:
const person = {
    firstName: "Ethan", 
    lastName: "Goddard", 
    age: 31, 
    hobbies: ["3D Printing", "Board Games", "Coding"], 
    isLoggedIn: false
    };

Arrays and Objects work together and provide far more power than each could on their own.
