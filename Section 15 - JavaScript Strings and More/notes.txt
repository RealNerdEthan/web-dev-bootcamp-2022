What we learned aboutin this section:

String properties: Give information about the string.
String methods: Creates a new copy of the sting and applies specified change(s) (.trim, .toUpperCase, etc).
String arguments: Are inputs that can be passed into a method to alter how they behave. (.indexOf, .slice, .replace, etc).

We also worked on several coding exercises and took quizes to test on our comprehension.

This is a string template literal: `"I am ${30 + 1} years old!`;

Null is purposful nothing. An example would be to have a variable called loggedInuser and set it to null until the user has loggged in.
We are intentionally giving no value to the variable.

Undefinied is JavaScript telling you it cannot find a value for your request. Example: "hello"[99] (there is no 99th 
index value for it to report back to you)
