---Loops---
Looping allows us to repeat code without having to re-write it over and over again.
Types of Loops: for loop, while loop, for...of loop, for...in loop

The three parts of the loop let(i=1; i<=100; i++) are:
i=1: The variable we create for the loop
i<100: The expression that needs to be true for the loop to continue (and which stops the loop once it is false)
i++: The increment or decriment method that we are changing the variable value during each loop (can be +, -, *, or /)

---While Loops---
They are most useful when the amount of time the loop runs is variable. It could involve user input or be part of a game loop.

---The Keyword "Break"---
When some condition becomes true, we "break" out of the loop and it will stop the execution immediately. Then code resumes
running after our loop.

---For...Of Loop---
In new in JavaScript and not supported by IE but is a significantly easier/better way to iderate over arrays and other iterables.
We can write a variable the correspondes to the individual element instead of a variable the correspondes to an index, which allows 
us to remove the need for to use i and iderate over it (i++).
